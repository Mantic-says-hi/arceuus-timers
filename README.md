# Arceuus Timers
An alternate implementation for Acreuus spellbook timers.

This plugin serves as a minor visual upgrade for Arceuus spells over the implementation in the RuneLite 'Timers' plugin.

## What is this plugin?
 - The RuneLite 'Timers' plugin shows the same icon regardless of the spell cast, this plugin changes that with\
   unique icons  based on the spell that is cast
    - This is the same spell icon for the 'Resurrect Superior Skeleton' 

   ### Latest Update
     - Spellbook Swap timer
        - Shows the time left to cast a spell before going back to the Lunar spellbook
     
   ### Unique thrall icons for Infoboxes
    - Custom icons for all thrall attack styles and subtypes
    - Custom icon  for thrall re-cast cooldown
    - Icons have been optimised to give more space for the time remaining text
      - Overall improving the visual clarity of the infobox timer

   ### Death Charge
   - An active Death Charge has no timer
      - Only the cooldown has a timer
      - Cooldown has a faded looking smaller icon

   ### Other spells not supported by RuneLite
    - Shadow Veil timer and cooldown
    - Ward of Arceuus Timer and cooldown
    - Dark Lure cooldown
    - Demonic and Sinister offering cooldown
    - Vile Vigour cooldown
   ### Multiple timer text options
   - Choose timer countdown from:
        - Seconds
        - Minutes
        - Game ticks

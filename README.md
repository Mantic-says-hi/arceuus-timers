# Arceuus Timers
An alternate implementation for Acreuus spellbook timers.

Created as a small project to learn from and have the satisfaction of the\
correct icon appearing when you summon each of the three thrall types

###Unique thrall icons
 - New icons for all thrall types and the cooldown
 - Time formatted for whole seconds instead of minutes:seconds
    - Infobox's removal goes off of ingame Varbits

###Death Charge
 - An active Death Charge has no timer 
    - Only the cooldown has a timer
    - Cooldown has a faded looking smaller icon

### No Config options yet

 - Personally I feel it's not needed / necessary to turn anything off
    -   However, if requested I will make config changes possible
